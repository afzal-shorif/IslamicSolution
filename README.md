# IslamicSolution
(This application was developed for Third Year University project.)

## Description
The main objective for this application is to make it easier to pray for people who reveived Islam as their religion later in life unlike the people born in an Islamic family. So they usually don't have much knowledge about the ways of Islam and don't have the Surahs memorized to offer Salah. Our app also has the features for learning the Arabic letters and memorizing the Surahs which are usually used in Surah.

## Features
1. Allows users to select specific prayers and Surahs.
2. Allows users to read and listen to Surahs.
3. Allows users to learn the meaning of the Surahs.
4. Allows users to learn Arabic alphabets.
4. Allow users to listen to Azan whenever they want.
